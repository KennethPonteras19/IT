Game Overview
Suspect.exe is an interactive text-based mystery game where you, the player,
is assigned with the role of a detective who is investigating the theft of a valuable
necklace from the mansion of Donya Rosalia. Gather evidence, interrogate suspects,
and make important decisions to identify the thief among the four suspects within 8
actions and 3 minutes. The objective is to collect fifty (50) points or more and
correctly accuse the thief before the time runs out.
The game draws inspiration from detective stories like Sherlock Holmes and
mystery-solving games like Professor Layton, with a text-based twist. It emphasizes
themes of deduction, observation, and critical thinking.
This game is open for all audiences due to its features that can be navigated
easily. This will surely get the interest of the people who are into playing games such
as solving mysteries and detective things that require problem solving and gathering
of data.
Game Features
Suspect.exe has several features which includes:
● Text-Based Gameplay: The game is text-driven, with players making
decisions depending on the information they gather from interrogations, clues,
and their analysis of the situation. Players must type their choices and the
name of the suspects.
● Suspects: Players can interrogate four suspects: Kenneth, Zy, Eunice, and
Aldwin. Each suspect provides varying responses when questioned, which
may help or hinder the investigation. In addition, each suspect is represented
by an illustration in the form of ASCII art.
● Alibis: Each suspect provides an alibi when interrogated. These alibis are
important in solving the mystery.
● Clues: Players can search for clues hidden around the mansion. These clues
may include objects that can be linked to the mystery.
● Timer: The game is time-limited. Players are given 3 minutes to solve the
case. This forces players to make a quick decision in their investigation.
● Actions Limit: Players are allowed to make 8 actions. Each chosen action,
whether it’s interrogating suspects, searching for clues, or making an
accusation, decreases the number of actions a player has.
● Accusation Mechanic: At any point of the game, players are allowed to
accuse one of the suspects. The players must use the information gathered
from interrogations and clues to make the correct accusation. If the chosen
suspect is accused incorrectly, the game deducts points and the player must
continue investigating before the timer runs out.
● Scoring: Players can attain points once they get a clue, however, if they
accused or chose the wrong person, points will be deducted.
